# Our Claim: poverty population trends will have a faster decrease than when Renassiance Pathways Program Policy is Implement.

We used data from the 2022 Census Bureau and supporting data about the affects of app finiancal literacy platforms from Data.gov

# Purpose:
The purpose of this Document is to state the process of creating R.P.P and the potiental outcomes 
- Household Income trends over time.
- Poverty levels across different years.

# Considerations before creating Forecast

How to make a predictive model to measure the sucess of investmenst renaasiance? 
What is sucess in our program? 
-Finanical Lifelong sucess
-Debt-low: Credit Card
   - Household Income will be in acesending order from 12 - 25 
   - Proverty Line will Decrease by 2025
     
# How 
We created a Time Series Forecasting to use a exponential smoother.
The prediction further aligns with our hypothesis for poverty population trends. 

# Iervention Modeling:

We can Simulate a 10% annual reduction in poverty due to financial literacy progra
ms.
Comparison of Scenarios:

Standard poverty projection (without intervention).
Accelerated poverty reduction (with financial interventions).
